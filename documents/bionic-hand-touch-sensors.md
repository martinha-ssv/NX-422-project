# Bionic Hand Touch Sensors

## Existing Bionic Hands with Touch Sensors

Although it is novel technology, there are a couple of products which feature touch sensors — typically FSRs.
- [Psyonic Ability Hand](https://www.psyonic.io/robots) - the [documentation](https://github.com/psyonicinc/ability-hand-api/blob/master/Documentation/ABILITY-HAND-ICD.pdf) describes the sensor outputs
- [Biohand RH56DFTP](https://store.foxtech.com/biohand-rh56dftp-dexterous-hand-with-tactile-sensor/?sku=R2502201) — robotic hand with 17 sensors' output
- [Biohand DexH13] — robotic hand with >2000 sensors' output
